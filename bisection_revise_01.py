#The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not #inclusive). The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using #bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!

#Start with upper bound of 100, lower bound of 0
